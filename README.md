# My own webCV :memo:

_CV was created during a seven-day HTML and CSS marathon organized by GoIT Poland.<br>
I joined it to get a better understanding of HTML's structure and usage.<br>
It was a worthwhile experience for me because it helped me expand my knowledge in this field and produced tangible results from my work that I could share with you._
